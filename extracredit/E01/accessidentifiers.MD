# Access identifiers
- Data Hiding is important feature of OOP. 
- Allows preventing of functions of a program to access directly the internal representation of a class type. 
- The 3 access identfiers: public, private, and protected. 

## Public member 
- Accessible from anywhere outside the class but within the program. 

## Private member
- Cannot be accessed, or even viewed from outside the class. Only the class and friend functions can access private members. 
- By default everything is declared private if it is not explicitally declared public or protected. 

## Protected member 
- Similiar to private member. 
- Can be accessed in derived classes of Base Classes.
