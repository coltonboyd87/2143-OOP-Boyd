# Encapsulation 
- Can be described as the process of wrapping data members and functions in a single unit. 
- The main objective of this is to prevent access to data directly. Access is provided by functions of the class. 
- Encapsulation is an umportant feature called data hiding. 

## This is achieved by: 
- Declaring data members private. 
- Make public setter and getter methods for each data memeber to set and get values of our data members.
