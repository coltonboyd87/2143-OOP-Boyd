## Basic OOP Terminology

- Class: An abstract description of the data and behavior of a collection of similiar objects.

- Object: A keyword used to indicate the definition of an object type. 

- Method: A procedure or function associated with a class (or object type) and invoked in a message - passing style. 

- Abstraction: A technique in problem solving in which details are grouped into a single small concept. This concept can then be viewed 
as a single identity and nonessential information ignored. 

- Encapsulation: The technique of hiding information within a structure, such as the hiding of instance data within a class. 

- Polymorphism: refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.

- Overloading: Used to describe an identifier that denotes more than one object.

- Attributes/Properties: Attributes are refering to additional information of an object. Properties are describing the characteristics of an object.

- Class Variable: A variable shared by all instances of a class. 

- Instance Variable: An internal variable maintained by an instance. Instance variables represent the state of an object.

- Member Variable: General term for the attributes associated with instances of a class. 

 - Inheritaance: The property of objects by which instances of a class can have access to data and method defintiions contained in a previosuly defined class. 
 
 - Multiple Inheritance: The feature that allows a subclass to inherit from more than one immediate subclass. 
 
 - Composition: The technique of including user-defined object types as part of a newly defined object.
